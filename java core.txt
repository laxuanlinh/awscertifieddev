Java Core

- Concepts of OOP
  - `Inheritence`
  - `Encapsulation`
  - `Abstraction`
  - `Polymorphism`
- `Inheritence`: is a character that a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class, in Java only single inheritence is permitted
- `Encapsulation` means bundling data and methods that operate on this data in a single unit, in case of Java it's an object
- `Abstraction` means hiding the execution and data of an object from outside access and only expose the necesscary part in a controlled manner
- `Polymorphism` is the ability of an object to behave differently depends on the way we instantiate it. Let's say we have a class Animal and Dog and Bird inheriting from Animal. When we instantiate an Animal object, that could be a generic Animal, could be a dog or a chicken, depends on the way we instantiate it, they can make different sound
