**Amazon S3**

- Amazon S3 allows to store objects in buckets
- Buckets are defined at region level
- Bucket names have no uppercase, no underscore, between 3-63 characters, begins with a letter or a number, not IP address
- Each object has a key, which is a path to the object
- The keys contain prefix + file name, example: s3://my-bucket/my_folder/my_file.txt
- There is no concept of directories in buckets but the UI will trick you otherwise
- Max object size is 5TB, if larger than that then must divide in to parts
- Objects can have metadata, tags, VersionID

***Versioning***
- Needs to be enabled at bucket level
- Same key upload will override and increment the version: 1, 2, 3,...
- It's best practice to version your buckets 

**S3 Encryption for Objects**
- There are 4 methods to encrypt objects

*SSE-S3*
- Encryption using keys handled by Amazon S3
- Objects are encrypted server-side
- AES-256 encryption type
- Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256" when upload to S3

*SSE-KMS*
- Same as SSE-S3
- KMS advantages over S3: user control + audit trail
- Set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms" when upload to S3

*SSE-C*
- Same as SSE-S3 and KMS but using key provided by user
- HTTPS must be used because the encryption key is being sent in the headers

*Client Side Encryption*
- Client library such as Amazon S3 Encryption Client
- Client must encrypt data before sending and decrypt themselves when retrieving from S3
- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

*Encryption in transit (SSl/TLS)*
- Amazon S3 exposes HTTP and HTTPS endpoints, it's recommended to user HTTPS
- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C

***S3 Security***
- User-based: IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- Resource-based: who can access the resource and what actions can be performed
  - Bucket Policies: bucket wide
  - Object ACL: finer grain
  - Bucket ACL: less common, not in the exam, probably
- An IAM principals (user, role) can access S3 object if 
  - The user IAM permissions allow it or the resource policy allows it
  - There is no explicit deny

*S3 Bucket Policies*
- JSON based policies
  - Resources: buckets and objects
  - Actions: Set of API to allow or deny
  - Effect: Allow or Deny
  - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 Bucket Policies to 
  - Grant public access to the bucket
  - Force upload encryption
  - Grant access to another account (Cross account)
- There is a setting to block access from public to buckets or objects

*Other S3 security*
- Networking
- Logging and Audit
- User security

*To add security policies to a bucket*
- Go to Permissions
- Go to Bucket Policy and select Edit => Policy Generator
- In Policy Generator, select the Type of Policy, in this case is S3 Bucket Policy
- In Add statements, the Effect could be allow or deny
- Principal is the IAM users or roles, can put "*" to represent all
- Select Actions, usually it's "PutObject"
- In Amazon Resource Name (ARN), put the ARN string of the bucket from the Edit Bucket policy page
- Click Add Conditions, select the Condition, the Key and Value, for example: condition = **StringNotEqual**, key = **s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption**, value = **true**
- Click Add Condition
- Click Add Statement then Generate Policy
- This should give a generated JSON file to copy to Policy page

***S3 websites***
- Go to Properties and enable Static website
- Upload and specify index.html and error.html
- Go to Permissions, disable Block public access(bucket settings)
- Go to Bucket Policy, generate a policy to Allow action PutObject for all Principal to the Bucket ARN

***S3 CORS***
- CORS is when a browser makes a request to an origin, then makes a request to another origin, example: make request to example.com then make another request to anotherexample.com.
- The second website needs to enable CORS in order for the browser to get a response.
- In S3, CORS happens when a browser get a html file from ***Bucket-1***, this html then asks the browser to make another request to bucket-2 to get css or images. This request contains a header origin=***Bucket-1*** and host=***Bucket2***. ***Bucket-2*** needs to enable CORS.
